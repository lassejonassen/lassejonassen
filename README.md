# Hey there
My name is Lasse Jonassen. I'm AP Computer Science student currently working at Arla, while i am trying to start my own software company. The idea of creating value for people and being able to make a living out of that is what is driving my passion for software development.

When im developing software i focus on the quality of my code and making it as simple as possible.
